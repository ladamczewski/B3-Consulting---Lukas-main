This assignment is designed to understand how you work and what your preferences are. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!!

Here the assignment:

We have to normalize several phone number formats. For example:

Valid format: `+34 636010203` 
Invalid formats: `636 01 02 03` , `636-01-02-03` or `34 636010203`

Our development team has coded a Test class, but functionality needs to be written. This is your target! Check Test class and modify code until all test run OK

Download the app from the repo, run it using:

`./mvnw clean install`

Your task is: hunt the bugs and upload the corrected source code back to Github. We have identify several problems:

- 1 compilation problems

- 1 functional problem

TODO in the source code with key functionality which should be implemented

As extra points:

Add a TODO file explaining what more you will do if you would have more than 30 minutes. This is important.

Add a very short README file explaining how to compile it, deploy it and use it. It may empty if you don't have time to do it, no problem at all. We'll discuss it later.
Some things you must consider:

If you are not familiar to git, this may take longer that expected. It's better to upload just one thing than nothing because lack of time.
Use English where you can use it.

Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.

Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are here to help.

Good luck and take it easy!
